# SQL-challenge

This project focuses on researching the data from employees of a corporation in the 1980's and 1990's. All that remains on the database of these employees are six CSV files. Data engineering and analysis were performed: tables were modeled into an ERD and designed to hold data, the CSVs were imported into and SQL database, and the data was analyzed. Bonus analysis and graphs were also created based on the average salary range for employees as well as the average salary by title.
